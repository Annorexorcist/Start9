# Start9
A Windows shell supplement, one which aims to be not only modular, but extensible to your heartâ€™s content.

Right now there's not much to see. Check back later for more information

### Dependencies and Frameworks
[These should be resolved by NuGet, but we want this to look longer or whatever]
- Runtime
  - .NET Framework 4.0
  - WPF
- Packages
  - ControlzEx
  - Fluent.Ribbon
  
## Roadmap
- [ ] Create a mostly final version of the Module + Skinning API and put it on NuGet
- [ ] Write the 14 base modules (these will probably be their own repository)
- [ ] Implement the Skin Designer (this will be moved out of this repo later)
- [ ] Write the Start9 Site (this will hold skins, modules, blog posts, etc. will be in another repo using ASP.NET)

Note these don't neccesarily have to be done in order; you can work on designing the Skin Designer whenever you want, we just wanted to lay our some sort of vague structure.
