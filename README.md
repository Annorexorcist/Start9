### Dependencies and Frameworks
[These should be resolved by NuGet, but we want this to look longer or whatever]
- Runtime
  - .NET Framework 4.0
  - WPF
- Packages
  - ControlzEx
  - Fluent.Ribbon
  
## Roadmap
- [ ] Create a mostly final version of the Module + Skinning API and put it on NuGet
- [ ] Write the 14 base modules (these will probably be their own repository)
- [ ] Implement the Skin Designer (this will be moved out of this repo later)
- [ ] Write the Start9 Site (this will hold skins, modules, blog posts, etc. will be in another repo using ASP.NET)

This roadmap doesn't need to be followed in this specific order; you can work on designing the Skin Designer, this is only to lay out some sort of vague structure.
